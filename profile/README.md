Whenever a popular actor’s movie is delayed for any reason, it affects both the movie’s business and the hero’s market. As a result, either the buzz around the movie is affected, or the opening collections are lower. Actor Nikhil Siddhartha’s upcoming release, Appudo Ippudo Eppudo, which is slated for release on November 8, is exactly in this situation.

This project was confirmed during the COVID-19 pandemic period and before the confirmation of Nikhil’s pan-India blockbuster, Karthikeya 2. When this project was greenlit, Nikhil didn’t have a pan-India image. However, the film was stalled midway after the London schedule due to some issues, and the halt continued for a long time. In the meantime, Karthikeya 2 was released and became a huge blockbuster.

Appudo Ippudo Eppudo is a Telugu romantic entertainer movie directed by Sudheer Varma. The movie casts Nikhil Siddharth and Rukmini Vasanth in the main lead roles along with Ajay, John Vijay, Viva Harsha, Satya, Sudharshan, and many others have seen in supporting roles. The songs were composed by Karthik and Sunny M.R scored background music while the cinematography was done by Richard Prasad and it is edited by Naveen Nooli.
